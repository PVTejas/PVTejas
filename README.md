- 👋 Hi, I’m @PVTejas
- 👀 I’m interested in aerospace engineering, control theory, Python, Minecraft(?), open source, and plenty more
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web hosting. I may have gotten nerd-sniped by it a while ago.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that can help reduce dependence on big tech.
- 📫 How to reach me: pvtejas@protonmail.com
